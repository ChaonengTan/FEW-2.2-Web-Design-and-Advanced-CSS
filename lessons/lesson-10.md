When you complete the challenges above your job is to create a component that will be included in your framework. You can use one of the challenge examples as a starting point. 

If you completed the challenges and you want to try something more challenging for your framework here are few ideas: 

- Make a custom component for the navbar. 
- Here are a couple tutorials that create a tab navigation component:
  - https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/examples/howto-tabs
  - https://piccalil.li/tutorial/solution-005-tabs/

### Apply best practice

When making your components they must use a hyphen. Best practice would have you use a prefix any tag names with the name of your framework. For example if you framework was named Corgi custom tag names might: 

- `<corgi-tabs></corgi-tabs>
- `<corgi-navbar></corgi-navbar>`
- `<corgi-carousel><corgi-carousel>` 

If the name of your framework is long use the initials. For example, imagine the name of your framework was "Stylin Styles" You might abbreviate to:

- `<ss-tabs></ss-tabs>`
- `<ss-navbar></ss-navbar>`
- `<ss-carousel><ss-carousel>`

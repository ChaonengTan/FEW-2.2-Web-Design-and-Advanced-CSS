## Use the Framework

Each framework has its systems and paradigms. For the most part, they will work in this way: 

- You will link to a stylesheet you may also have the option to include a JS file. 
- Linking to the stylesheet will add a set of default styles that cover the common tags like:
	- Base font and typography
	- Headings
	- Links
	- Lists 
	- Tables 
	- form elements

The framework will offer more styles and custom elements that are created by using a combination of markup/HTML and class names.

- buttons
- cards

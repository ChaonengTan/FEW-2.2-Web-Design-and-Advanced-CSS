## Use the Framework

Each framework has its systems and paradigms. For the most part, they will work in this way: 

- You will link to a stylesheet you may also have the option to include a JS file. 
- Linking to the stylesheet will add a set of default styles that cover the common tags like:
	- Base font and typography
	- Headings
	- Links
	- Lists 
	- Tables 
	- form elements

The framework will offer more styles and custom elements that are created by using a combination of markup/HTML and class names. 

- Navbars
- buttons
- cards
- other features...

## Making your Own Framework

## After Class

Your goal is to create your own CSS Framework. This will be a stylesheet that has all of the base styles that you might use in any project. 

You can emulate the features in the frameworks above. Look at the ideas these contain, implement them in yout framework with your own ideas. 

Get started by downloading the starter code:

Copy this repo above. It contains a single html file. You will add a stylesheet that styles contents of this file. 

The HTML file contains a range of typeical elements that you will see in any web site. The stylesheet you create should style these things so they look better than the default styles!

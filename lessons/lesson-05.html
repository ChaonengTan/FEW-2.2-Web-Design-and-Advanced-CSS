  <h1>Typography Sample</h1>

  <h2>What is this?</h2>

  <p class="lead">This page contains several common tags that you will see 
    on almost any web page. The goal is to style all of the 
    type here so it looks good and reads well reads well.</p>

  <p>Get started by looking at the page without any styles. 
    Next apply some styles. Use your judgement and get feedback
    from anyone available. Listen to what people think and 
  and apply their suggestions.</p>

  <h2>Challenges</h2>

  <p class="lead">Read the challenges and follow the instructions for each. You 
    will be styling this document along the way. Keep your eye on it 
    and make it look the best you can. </p>

  
  <h3 id="challenge-1">Challenge 1 - <span class="text-muted">Create a stylesheet</span></h3>

  <p class="lead">Create a new stylesheet and link it to this document.</p>

  <h3 id="challenge-2">Challenge 2 - <span class="text-muted">Define a base font style</span></h3>

  <p class="lead">Define a font style by setting rules on the body element in your stylesheet.</p>
  
  <p>Set a font-family to a font-stack or a custom font.</p>
  
  <p>Set the font-size, and the line-height to make the font read well. 
    Use your best judegment here.</p>

  <h3 id="challenge-3">Challenge 3 - <span class="text-muted">Define heading styles</span></h3>

  <p class="lead">Define styles for the H1-h6. Do this by setting them to a value in em.
    For example: h1: 2em. Get the sizes to step down in size. You can also 
    set the weight and color if you think it will look better. 
  </p>

  <p>Headings are meant to lead in or label a section. We use them not becuase the 
    text is larger but because we want to say that the text within the h# tag is 
    the name of a section or labels a big idea on the page. 
  </p>

  <p>Take a look at the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/content/typography/#headings">headings on the Bootstrap</a> site. 
    <a href="https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/typography-base.html#header">Foundation headings</a> are also worth looking at. 
    Emulate these in your design. Set your styles and keep your on this page. Headings 
    are used throughout, below is a sample of all of the headings h1-h6. 
  </p>

  <div>
    <h1>Heading h1</h1>
    <h2>Heading h2</h2>
    <h3>Heading h3</h3>
    <h4>Heading h4</h4>
    <h5>Heading h5</h5>
    <h6>Heading h6</h6>
  </div>

  <h3 id="challenge-4">Challenge 4 - <span class="text-muted">Style inline elements</span></h3>

  <p class="lead">Inline elements are all of the modifcations you to text in a standard paragraph 
    to make it say more.
  </p>

  <p>Inline elements include the strong, em (emphasis), abbr (abbreviation), 
    del (deleted), s (strike-through), and mark (hightlighted). People will use these
    to increase the communication and nuance of the language written on a page. For 
    example some things are said with a strong voice, other points you will want to 
    emphasize, or mark (imagine highlighting text). 
  </p>

  <p>
    Style the tags below and look at the sample text and other text on this page 
    to see how your styles are working. You can stick with the default style or 
    add your own rules. You can style the font-weight, color, background-color, 
    text-decoration and anything else you can think of. 
  </p>

  <div>
    <p><strong>Text using the strong tag</strong></p>
    <p><em>Text using the em tag</em></p>
    <p><abbr>Text using the abbr tag</abbr></p>
    <p><del>Text using the abbr tag</del></p>
    <p><s>Text using the s tag</s></p>
    <p><mark>Text using the mark tag</mark></p>
  </div>

  <p>Take a look at what Bootstrap does with 
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/content/typography/#inline-text-elements">these</a>. </p>

  <h3 id="challenge-5">Challenge 5 - <span class="text-muted">Color</span></h3>

  <p class="lead">Color is important. By default text is black and 
    the background color of the page is white. This is rather harsh, 
    and doesn't look that great. You can do better!  
  </p>

  <p>Style the color and background color on the body tag in your 
    stylesheet. Use colors with good contrast. Check your colors 
    on the <a href="https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/">contrast checker</a>. 
  </p>

  <h3 id="challenge-6">Challenge 6 - <span class="text-muted">Links</span></h3>

  <p class="lead">Links are important. They need to stand out from the text 
    around them and let visitors know that something is clickable 
    and will lead to more information. 
  </p>

  <p>Links by default are blue and have an underline. You can change both 
    of these things for an improvement! Links also have styles that apply 
    to their interactive states: hover, active, and visited. You should 
    style these also. 
  </p>

  <div>
    <p>This paragrah contains links to the vaious sections on this page. 
      If you have gotten this far you have <a href="#challenge-1">created a stylesheet</a>, 
      then you defined a <a href="#challenge-2">base font</a>, next it was 
      <a href="#challenge-3">heading styles</a>, follwed by 
      <a href="#challenge-4">inline styles</a>, and then <a href="#challenges-5">colors.</a> 
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>You should style the :hover, :active, and :visited pseudo classes. 
    Read about these <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Styling_links">here</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="challenge-7">Challenge 7 - <span class="text-muted">Blockquotes</span></h3>

  <p class="lead">Blocks quotes are used present a quoted block of text. Usually you'll 
    also add a citation which says where the quote came from or who it is attributed to.
  </p>

  <p>The blockquote is a tag, the citation is another tag, and you might use more tags 
    in conjunction with these to make a good looking blockquote. Take a look at the 
    markup used by <a href="https://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/typography-base.html#blockquotes">Foundation</a> 
    and <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/content/typography/#blockquotes">Bootstrap</a>.
    Then write some styles for the blockquote and the cite tag when it appears inside a blockquote. 
    Keep your eye on the example blockquotes below. I've marked up the quoted below with p and cite 
    inside the blockquote.

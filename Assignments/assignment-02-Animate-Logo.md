# FEW 2.2 - Animate your Logo

## Description 

Animation isn't easy, you need to practice. This assignment asks you to spend three hours adding animation to the previous assignment. 

### Why this assignment?

Animation adds spice and interest to your work. It can also improve user experience. Your favorite apps all use animation to some degree. If you want to make engaging applications you'll need to make them move!

## Project requirements

Starting with the previous assignment, where you drew a logo or icon with CSS, add animation.

You must **animate at least three properties**. For example: `background-color`, `tranform: scale() rotate()`. Animate more if you dare! 

### Deliverable

A link to your project on codepen.  

### Due date

Class 3

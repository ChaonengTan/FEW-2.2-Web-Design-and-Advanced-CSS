# FEW 2.2 - Apply SASS to a past project

## Description 

The goal of this assignment is to apply SASS to a project. You can choose any past web project as long as it has a stylesheet. 

If you don't have a suitable project contact me and I will give you a project to work on.

### Why this assignment?

SASS is a common industry tool. You should know what it is and how it works. By implementing SASS in your own work you will get a close up view of what it does and how to work with it. 

## Project requirements

There are two parts to this assignment. The first part is to apply SASS to a project and improve the typography of your site. The second part is to present a short two minute presentation on a technique that you used with SASS. 

**Part 1.**

Choose a web project or contact me and I will give you a web project to work on. The project must be on GitHub. 

Create a branch where you will apply SASS. 

Add SASS to your project. Apply SASS in as many ways as you can think. Try these ideas: 

- Use [variables](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/variables)
  - Move all of the variables definitions to the top of the stylesheet or in a separate file of constants.
  - Use variables to avoid repeating values
  - Advanced: [String Interpolation](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/interpolation)
- Use expressions and [operators](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/operators) to calculate values. This idea can be applied to: 
  - Color, see colors functions
  - Margin and padding values 
  - Font sizes 
  - Heights and widths
- Use for [loops](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control) to automate your stylesheet.
  - Any time code looks repetetive use a loop!
- Use [conditional](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/control) logic
  - Look at values and make decisions about what CSS should be written
- Use [Lists](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/functions/list) to organize your code
- Use mixins to make it easier to apply complex rules. 
- Break your code into separate files using [@import](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/import#partials)
  - Organize your by file
- Use built in [functions](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/functions) for special operations
  - Color manipulation
  - Inspect and manipulate selectors
  - String functions
  

**Part 2**

For part two you should work with another student. Between the two of you come up with a 2 minute presentation on a technique you used with SASS and Type. You need to show a code sample in a GitHub gist.

The goal is show a simple technique that anyone in class could apply to their work. A code sample and live example of the technique. 

### Deliverable

A link to the branch of your project that uses SASS. 

Your GitHub Gist and live code sample. 

### Due date

Class 4

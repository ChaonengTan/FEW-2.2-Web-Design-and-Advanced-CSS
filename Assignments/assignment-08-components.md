# FEW 2.2 - Advanced CSS - Framework Components

## Description 

Besides all of the default elements your framework should offer some build in "components". These are things that can be used to present content in alternative ways. 

### Why this assignment?

Your framework is almost complete these are the details that will take it across the finish line making it useful in a wider range of cases. 

## Project requirements

Finish your framework by supporting the components below. Each of these components should implemented with sensible markup and a class name. Use selectors to your advantage here. 

Along with each of the components listed below I've included links to samples of these components implement by Bootstrap, Foundation, and Materialize. Follow their lead. Looks closely at the markup they have used and the class names. 

Keep it simple. Don't over think these. Get the minimum features working to where it looks acceptable and move on to the next. By creating minimal style they can be used in more situations and modified by our end users.

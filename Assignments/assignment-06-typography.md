# FEW 2.2 - Assignment 4 - Improve your Typography

## Description 

Web sites are mostly text. People are absorbing your content on mobile phones by reading and inputing text. It's important that your text looks good and more important that reads clearly. 

### Why this assignment?

Understand how type works and the features of typography will make your projects look better and be more engaging. 

## Project requirements

Choose a past project and improve the typography, your project must be on GitHub. 

Make a branch in your GitHub project. Name it for the type improvements. Do your work on this branch. 

Adjust the type in these ways:

- If appropriate Use a custom font for your project otherwise use one of the [Font Stacks from lesson 4](../lessons/lesson-04.md#ui-system-fonts)  
  - Use a custome font - https://fonts.google.com
  - Use a system font - [Font Stacks from lesson 4](../lessons/lesson-04.md#ui-system-fonts)  
- Set a base font on the body. Set the `font-family` and `font-size`
  - Set the `font-family` on the body or html elements (while this will not change the appearance it will make working with typographic styles easier.)
- Adjust the font sizes in `ems`. Set the `font-size` in `em` to make elements larger and smaller than the base size defined on the body. 
  - Adjust font styles for headings. For example `h`1 { 2em; }`
- Adjust the line height in the body. The base line-height is too small use 1.5em as a starting point. The goal is to use line-height to make the text more easy to read. use your best judgement. 
- Set the color and background color
  - Check the contrast: https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/
- Ask yourself these questions?
  - Does this look good?
  - Does this read well?

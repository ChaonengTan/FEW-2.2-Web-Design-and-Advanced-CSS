# FEW 2.2 - Assignment 4 - Fromework fonts 

## Description 

This is the first step in the larger goal of creating CSS framework. The goal of this first step is defining typography for the framework. 

### Why this assignment?

The web is dominated by text content. To get noticed and make sites that people enjoy reading your type should look good. 

## Project requirements

The goal for this assignment is to start your framework by defining styles that define good looking typography. 

You need to create a repo for your framework. Think of a name for your framework. 

You need to define typographic styles for your framework. Think about making a legible, easy read, and good type. You should style all of the default text. Style the color and the background color. Make sure the contrast meets the [guide lines](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/). 

Use these styles:

- font-family
- line-height
- font-size
- color
- background-color (body)

Style these elements:

- body
- p
- h1-6
- block-quote
- strong
- em

You must set a base font style on body. All other elements will inherit from this. You can use a px size here. 

Style all of the other elements using a relative size in em. 

Move as many values as practical into CSS custom properties in an easily accessible location of your stylesheet. 

### Deliverable

Link to your repo.

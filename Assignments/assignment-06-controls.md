# FEW 2.2 - Assignment 6 - Controls 

## Description 

The goal is to make progress on the CSS framework and focus on controls. 

### Why this assignment?

Great looking forms set sites apart. The default styles for form elements leave a lot to be desired. 

## Project Requirements

Add styles to your CSS frame that create reasonable styles for form controls. You shoul style these elements: 

- button
- input[text], input[email], input[password]
- input[radio], input[checkbox]
- textarea

Decide on how you will use SASS. Remember SASS will need to be compiled. 

Definitely use CSS Custom Properties apply common values and calculate related values where possible. 

**Stretch goals**

There are more input types than: text, email, and password. These also appear differently than a standard text field and will appear different across browsers. 

When styling these be sure to use the label to your advantage where appropriate. For example input[file] might best be _handled with the label while the input itself is hidden_.

- input[file]
- input[search]
- input[color]
- input[date]
- input[image]

You may want to search examples of these in the wild and look at how other frameworks handle these to inform your choices. 

## Deliverables

Your new styles for controls should be added to your framework. 

Documentation for your framework. Include a code snippet showing markup for each element your framework styles.

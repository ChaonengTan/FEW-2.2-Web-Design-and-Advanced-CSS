# FEW 2.2 - Apply SASS to a past project

## Description 

The goal of this assignment is to apply SASS to a project. You can choose any past web project as long as it has a stylesheet. 

If you don't have a suitable project contact me and I will give you a project to work on. 

### Why this assignment?

SASS is a common industry tool. You should know what it is and how it works. By implementing SASS in your own work you will a close up view of what it does and how to work with it. 

## Project requirements

There are two parts to this assignment. The first part is to apply SASS to a project and improve the typography of your site. The second part is to present a short two minute presentation on a technique that you used with SASS and Type in your project. 

**Part 1.**

Choose a project a web project or contact me and I will give you a web project to work on. The project must be on GitHub. 

Create a branch where you will apply SASS. 

Add SASS to your project. Apply SASS in as many ways as you can think. Try these ideas: 

- Use variables
  - Move all of the variables definitions to the top of the stylesheet or in a separate file of constants
  - Use variables to avoid repeating values
  - Use variables to calculate values. This idea can be applied to: 
    - Color, see colors functions
    - Margin and padding values 
    - Font sizes 
    - Heights and widths
  - Use for loops to automate your stylesheet. 
  - Use mixins to make it easier to apply complex rules.

For part two you should work with anotehr student. Between the two of you come up with a 2 minute presentation on a technique you used with SASS and Type. You need to show a code sample in a GitHub gist.

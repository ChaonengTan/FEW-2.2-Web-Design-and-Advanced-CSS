## Class Assignments

We will begin the term reviewing CSS concepts. Then move into new concepts that you will apply to your projects. The final project is to build a CSS framework. 

### Custom CSS Framework

You will be building a CSS framework to use for the frontend of any web project. It's like making your own [Bootstrap!](https://getbootstrap.com/). It's about time that someone challenged Bootstrap and produced a viable replacement that is leaner, more flexible, and easier to use by implementing new CSS tools. 

You'll build this framework throughout the course, with a midterm check-in to show progress and get feedback, as well as a final presentation in front of the class, where you show an example of your framework in use on a web app (previous project, sample static page used for the demo, etc.)

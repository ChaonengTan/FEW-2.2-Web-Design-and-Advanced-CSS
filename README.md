## Class Assignments

### Custom CSS Framework

- **Midterm Presentation Due Date: Beginning of Class 7**
- **Final Presentation Due Date: Beginning of Class 12**

You will be building a CSS framework to use for the frontend of any web project. It's like making your own [Bootstrap!](https://getbootstrap.com/)

You'll build this framework throughout the course, with a midterm checkin to show progress and get feedback, as well as a final presentation in front of the class, where you show an example of your framework in use on a web app (previous project, sample static page used for the demo, etc.)

**Full spec for this project coming soon!**

### Product Design

- **Wireframes + 1st draft of homepage due: Beginning of Class 9**
- **Final wireframes + final draft of homepage due: Beginning of Class 12**

**Requirements**

- It can be an imaginary product, an improvement on an existing product, or a real product that doesn't exist yet
- You need to make wireframes for the product that show how the user will interact with the product
